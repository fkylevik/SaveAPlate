                About Us
                 <br />
                Welcome to SaveAPlate – where saving the planet starts in your kitchen.

                SaveAPlate is a project developed by passionate students at Chalmers University of Technology with a mission to make sustainable living accessible, practical, and budget-friendly.

                Our goal is simple: help people from all walks of life reduce food waste and save money by generating smart, delicious recipes using the ingredients they already have at home.

                We believe that sustainability doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Whether you're a student trying to stretch your grocery budget, a busy parent looking to minimize waste, or anyone in between, SaveAPlate is here to support you with personalized, eco-friendly meal ideas.

                This tool is designed to empower a diverse community to make small changes that lead to a big impact — for both your wallet and our planet.

                Join us in turning everyday cooking into a step toward a greener future. </p>
